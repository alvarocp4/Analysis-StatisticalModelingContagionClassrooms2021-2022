# Analysis-StatisticalModelingContagionClassrooms2021-2022
Final Degree Project that sought to analyze the probability of contagion of COVID-19 in the classroom.
This paper collects data from: [Datadista](https://github.com/datadista/datasets). It aims to analyze the probability of contagion in classrooms during the 2021/2022 school year based on the data collected by the different agencies in charge of collecting the COVID-19 contagions. It is important to know that the probability of contagion has been collected from the website: [AirBorne](https://airborne.cam/).

From the data chosen, they have been purified to: "age_groups_madrid.csv".
